The simple plugin that allows you to display image slides with title, description and read more linked to posts from selected category.

== Description ==
The simple plugin that allows you to display image slides with title, description and read more linked to posts from selected category. The slide title and description appear with slide-in animation effect.
The user may select the category or display items of all categories. 
Number of slides is unlimited and you may specify how many slides you want to be visible in column.
